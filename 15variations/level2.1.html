    <h1> TEN PRINCIPLES FOR GOOD DESIGN <h1>
    <h4> Dieter Rams <h4>
        <br>
        <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Good design is innovative.</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design. But innovative design always develops <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.

<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Good design makes a product useful.</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasises the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anything that could possibly detract from it.

<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Good design is aesthetic.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <em> aesthetic quality </em> of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.

<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Good design makes a product understandable.</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.

<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Good design is unobtrusive.</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user’s self-expression.

<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Good design is honest.</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.

<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Good design is long-lasting.</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years – even in today’s throwaway society.

<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail.
</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the consumer.

<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. Good design is environmentally friendly.
</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimises physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.

<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10. Good design is as little design as possible.
</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity.
